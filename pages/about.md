# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

Hi I’m Dinesh :wave:, a senior in Computer Science submatriculating in robotics at Upenn. I will graduate in May 2021 and I’m looking for a full-time software engineer position.


I’m experienced in Java, Python, Javascript, C/C++. I have a good understanding in data structure & algorithm, as well as experience in web development (Javascript, HTML/CSS, React.js, Node.js), Mobile App Development(Kotin), C++ & Java OO design, and system programming (concurrency, synchronization, TCP socket).

I am deeply interested in creating efficient, reliable, and useful systems in software engineering and robotics.
