description: An examination of the US-accidents dataset which contains data on countrywide traffic accidents (over 2.5 million accidents) from 2016 - 2020). Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand and make inferences for any patterns and abnormalities within the data. Specifically, I looked into how different features of the data affect the severity of an accident taking place. Built models to predicts the severity of an accident given certain environmental features (achieved over 72% accuracy)
